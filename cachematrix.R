## Write a short comment describing this function
## The function cacheSolve takes the output of the previous matrix makeCacheMatrix(matrix) as an 
# input and checks inverse matrix from makeCacheMatrix(matrix) has any value in it or not.
# In case inverse matrix from makeCacheMatrix((matrix) is empty, it gets the original matrix data from 
# and set the invertible  matrix by using the solve function.
# In case inverse matrix from makeCacheMatrix((matrix) has some value in it (always works
#after running the code 1st time), it returns a message  "Getting Cached Invertible Matrix" 
#and the cached object
